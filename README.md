Created for Ludum Dare 38.

The Game Jam's theme was " Small World." We thought up what is essentially a RTS game, but instead of taking place on flat maps, the level is a globe. Players scramble to capture outposts that spawn mobs. Depending on the type of outpost captured, the mobs will either attack enemy bases or defend their own base.

The matchmaking is still in its infancy, and as a result only supports up to 20 concurrent players. Sorry about that :(

Features:

Network multiplayer for up to 8 players.
Mob spawning outposts.
An 80s aesthetic.
Funky fresh tunes!
